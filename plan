What to do?
    refactor?
    refactor what?
    refactor the planetsystem to only take types with radiuses + planet 
    get rid of particle?
    pretty useless
    never going to use it
    or add radius to particle
    why is this hard
    or make a class (planetsystemview) with a planetsystem, but the planetsystem which gets passed into the template needs a type with a radius
    planetsystemview maintains shapes
    can draw them if needed
    can delete planets
    good idea?
    no fucking clue
